Welcome to Derek McGuire's Final Project Repository!

Please see the following Documents:
<br>Final Project - Proposal Template - PDF
<br>The Tree Harvest - ERD (PDF)
<br>The Tree Harvest - URI Mapping (PDF)

These documents explain the project, the Entity Relationships, and the "commands" to use in the REST Web API Server of your choice.

Please note that this project has the dependencies for Swagger in place.

Also, there is a "drops.sql" file that has a quick script to drop all the tables in case you want to start over. It is recommended that you use "data.sql" and run the INSERT statements to establish the trees.

There are JSON files to easily copy and paste into a REST Web API Server that allow you to create Foresters, Tree Fields, and Trees.
